IN THIS TASK, I FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING A BRANDING CONCEPT FOR A CLOTHING BRAND NAMED "BATER LOOM". THE LOGO DESIGN IS BASED ON A MONOGRAM ALSO REFERRED TOO AS A LETTERMARK- AS IT INCORPORATES THE INITIALS "B" AND "L". THE OVERALL CONCEPT IS TAILORED FOR A CLOTHING BRAND, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ITS PACKAGING STYLE.

TO BRING THE CONCEPT TO LIFE, I USED 3D MOCKUPS TO VISIUALIZE THE DESIGN ON APPAREL AND PACKAGING MATERIALS. THE COLOR PALATTE IS MINIMALIST, ALIGNING WITH MODERN BRANDING AESTHETICS. ALL COLORS AND MOCKUPS USED IN THIS CONCEPT ARE SHOWCASED IN THE IMAGES UPLOADED ABOVE
